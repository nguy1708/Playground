# Playground
This is a personal repository with snippets of code concepts that I am teaching myself. This is primarily done in swift with xcode.

* MyPlayground - has some code pertaining to the uses of classes and subclasses. What is useful here is the use of enum and closures as well as how to work with optionals in them
* MyPlayground2 - This is an empty sheet
